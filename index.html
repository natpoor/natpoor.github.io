 <b>Country Level Open Data Predictors</b><br />
 This graph compares a nation's open data score (Y axis) with the score as predicted by a regression model (X axis, see below).
 It uses three variables (democracy, innovation, and GDP) to attempt to predict the open data score. The model isn't perfect, but can show 
 nations that might be over-achievers so we can learn from them, ones that might be under-achievers so we can make them better,
 and (not shown) other nations that have measures for the three predictor variables can have their open data score estimated
 with the model and we can see which ones score highly and could be a good focus for expanded open data (as it turns out, most
 of the ones in this category don't score very high).
 <br /><br />
 The predictor variables are all of theoretical interest, and so we hope they also have some statistical predictive weight,
 which they do. Democracy as a form of citizen-involved government seems like an obvious choice for a predictive variable.
 Innovation may be also, as open data is innovative in some ways and requires an innovative push to make it happen.
 GDP may be of interest, as creating digital data, organizing it, and making it digitally available all take economic resources.
 <br /><br />
 The graph uses D3.js for the visualization, in part so I could learn a bit of D3. It isn't very complex as D3 visualizations are,
 but I think the mouseover tool tips are a nice addition to regular static graphs.

<b>What does this mean?</b><br />
The model, a regression run in R, shows that democracy is really important for open data! How important? Important enough that
there is an exponential relationship between the two. (I noticed this when I plotted just the democracy score against the
open data score, the scatterplot wasn't roughly linear, it curved up, thus, more is more.) So, more democracy generally means
even more open data in a non-linear relationship (so like 1=1, 2=4, 3=9, etc).
<a href="http://www.rstreet.org/2014/05/22/democracy-and-open-data-are-the-two-linked/">Molly Schwartz wrote about the
relationship in May 2014</a> but with a different analysis than I use here. However, innovation and GDP are important as well,
just not as important, as you can see by the standardized (relative to each other) coefficients. We use these because
the predictors all use different units/scales. (So we can see that democracy is roughly twice as important as innovation,
according to this model with these specifics measures -- 0.566 and 0.260.)
<br /><br />
<i>Variable scales:</i><br />
<ul>
 <li>Open data: 0-100 (percentage). Higher = more open data.</li>
 <li>Democracy index: 1.00 - 9.99 (essentially 1.00 - 10.00, two decimal places). Higher = more democracy.</li>
 <li>Global innovation: 0.00 - 100 (two decimal places). Higher = more innovation.</li>
 <li>GDP: $US in millions. Higher = more GDP.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<i>Model notes:</i><br />
There are two things to note: the exponential term for the democracy score, and its inclusion since its p-value is just over 0.10.
<ol>
<li>The exponential term, that is, more democracy results in an even greater open data index score (exponentially not just linearly),
shows the importance of democracy to open data (again, <a href="http://www.rstreet.org/2014/05/22/democracy-and-open-data-are-the-two-linked/">Molly Schwartz's article</a>). But it means that the variables are centered, that is, the average of each is subtracted 
from each observation (so the mean of the centered version of each variable becomes zero). The you can make the squared term.
I put a 'C' in the centered versions of the variables, as you can see in the model (I could have renamed everything for
presentation but it's easy enough to understand).</li>
<li>If you know statistics a little, you might recall that p-values are taught as a cutoff. <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700">Except that's not exactly right</a>.
P-values are a general guide that allow us to discerne variables of interest or, if we already know some varaibles that are theoretically
relevant we can then tell if we should keep them in the model. So, a p-value of 0.1116 for the democracy squared term is fine.
That tells us that we are 88.84% sure that there is a statistical relationship between the democracy squared term and the dependent variable (Open Data score),
given the other variables, <i>all other things being equal</i>. But all other things aren't equal. We know democracy is relevant theoretically,
and from looking at the scatterplot for the democracy score and the open data score (not shown here) it is clear it's a non-linear relationship
(one that looks like an exponential relationship!). So we keep it, because we know that a p-value just over 0.10 is fine for theoretically relevant variables.
("Just over" well how much is ok? That's a judgement call that will vary in each situation.)</li>
</ol>
<br />
Lastly, the adjusted R-squared, a measure of how much of the variance of the dependent variable is explained by the model,
is 0.6007, so about 60% of what is going on with the Open Data score is explained by the model, which is really good
(it's especially a good amount for the social sciences).
<br /><br />
<i>Other indexes/variables I didn't use:</i>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index">Press Freedom Index</a>, 2014, via Wikipedia,
from Reporters Without Borders. It was barely significant statistically in most
models I ran, but it worked in the wrong direction (that is, in the direction opposite what theory and common sense say). Why? 
It's not clear. Possibly it's because it's based on self-reported data (although just because data is self-reported doesn't
mean there is anything wrong with it, note), or possibly its effect is overwhelmed by the other variables in the regression. 
The correlation between press freedom and the open data score is in the theorized direction, but that only works when press freedom
is on its own. In theory, freedom to publicize information should correlate with an open data score in a positive manner.</li> 
<li>
 I also looked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom">the Index of Economic Freedom</a> (2014)
 but it was never close to statistical significance in this model and was included for exploratory purposes (that is, I wasn't
 convinced it should be in the model in the first place, but it was worth investigating).
</li>
<li>Lastly, I included the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/education-index">UN's education index</a>,
and although it sounds like a good bet in terms of theory (the population must be educated to code for data)
and on its own it had a decent correlation with open data (>0.6), in the model it was not near to statistical significance.
</li>
</ol>
