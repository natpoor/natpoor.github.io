 <b>Country Level Open Data Predictors</b><br />
 This graph compares a nation's open data score (Y axis) with the score as predicted by a regression model (X axis, see below).
 It uses three variables (democracy, education, and GDP) to attempt to predict the open data score. The model isn't perfect, but can show 
 nations that might be over-achievers so we can learn from them, ones that might be under-achievers so we can make them better,
 and (not shown) other nations that have measures for the three predictor variables can have their open data score estimated
 with the model and we can see which ones score highly and could be a good focus for expanded open data (as it turns out, most
 of the ones in this category don't score very high).
 <br /><br />
 The predictor variables are all of theoretical interest, and so we hope they also have some statistical predictive weight,
 which they do. Democracy as a form of citizen-involved government seems like an obvious choice for a predictive variable.
 Education may be also, as open data requires educated citizens (well a few at least, to code and understand concepts).
 GDP may be of interest, as creating digital data, organizing it, and making it digitally available all take economic resources.
 <br /><br />
 The graph uses D3.js for the visualization, in part so I could learn a bit of D3. It isn't very complex as D3 visualizations are,
 but I think the mouseover tool tips are a nice addition to regular static graphs. (I had to jitter some of the points and then
 hand-tweak some of the text label positions.)

<b>What does this mean?</b><br />
The model, a regression run in R, shows that democracy is really important for open data! How important? Important enough that
there is an exponential relationship between the two. (I noticed this when I plotted just the democracy score against the
open data score, the scatterplot wasn't roughly linear, it curved up, thus, more is more.) So, more democracy generally means
even more open data in a non-linear relationship (so like 1=1, 2=4, 3=9, etc).
<a href="http://www.rstreet.org/2014/05/22/democracy-and-open-data-are-the-two-linked/">Molly Schwartz wrote about the
relationship in May 2014</a> but with a different analysis than I use here. However, innovation and GDP are important as well,
just not as important, as you can see by the standardized (relative to each other) coefficients. We use these because
the predictors all use different units/scales. (So we can see that democracy is roughly three as important as education and GDP,
according to this model with these specifics measures.)
<br /><br />
<i>Variable scales:</i><br />
<ul>
 <li>Open data: 0-100 (percentage). Higher = more open data.</li>
 <li>Democracy index: 1.00 - 9.99 (essentially 1.00 - 10.00, two decimal places). Higher = more democracy.</li>
 <li>Eduction index: 0 - 1.00. Higher = more education.</li>
 <li>GDP: $US in millions. Higher = more GDP.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<i>Model notes:</i><br />
The exponential term for the democracy variable shows that more democracy results in an even greater open data index score (exponentially not just linearly),
shows the importance of democracy to open data (again, <a href="http://www.rstreet.org/2014/05/22/democracy-and-open-data-are-the-two-linked/">Molly Schwartz's article</a>). But it means that the variables are centered, that is, the average of each is subtracted 
from each observation (so the mean of the centered version of each variable becomes zero). The you can make the squared term.
I put a 'C' in the centered versions of the variables, as you can see in the model (I could have renamed everything for
presentation but it's easy enough to understand).
<br />
I had an interesting path finding the right variables, and then had serious multicolinearity issues and had to do somewhat
arcane sounding things like checking the VIF in order to see which variables were stepping on the toes of the other variables.
I found some helpful blog posts about it all, 
<a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/understanding-statistics/handling-multicollinearity-in-regression-analysis">here is one</a>,
<a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/adventures-in-statistics/what-are-the-effects-of-multicollinearity-and-when-can-i-ignore-them">here is the other</a>. 
<br />
Lastly, the adjusted R-squared, a measure of how much of the variance of the dependent variable is explained by the model,
is 0.613, so about 61% of what is going on with the Open Data score is explained by the model, which is really good
(it's especially a good amount for the social sciences).
<br /><br />
<i>Other indexes/variables I didn't use:</i>
<ol>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index">Press Freedom Index</a>, 2014, via Wikipedia,
from Reporters Without Borders. It was barely significant statistically in most
models I ran, but it worked in the wrong direction (that is, in the direction opposite what theory and common sense say). Why? 
It's not clear. Possibly it's because it's based on self-reported data (although just because data is self-reported doesn't
mean there is anything wrong with it, note), or possibly its effect is overwhelmed by the other variables in the regression. 
The correlation between press freedom and the open data score is in the theorized direction, but that only works when press freedom
is on its own. In theory, freedom to publicize information should correlate with an open data score in a positive manner.</li> 
<li>
 I also looked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_of_Economic_Freedom">the Index of Economic Freedom</a> (2014)
 but it was never close to statistical significance in this model and was included for exploratory purposes (that is, I wasn't
 convinced it should be in the model in the first place, but it was worth investigating).
</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.globalinnovationindex.org/">Global Innovation Index</a>, 2014, worked pretty well as a 
variable until I found and included the <a href="http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/education-index">UN's education index</a>,
beause the two correlated too highly and it was causing problems in the model (the multicolinearity I discuss above).
The education index ended up working better in terms of the statistics. This doesn't mean that innovation, as measured
by this index, doesn't play a part, it just means that in this model (which includes the UN education index) the GII
doesn't add enough information that is different from the education measure.
